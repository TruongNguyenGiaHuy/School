  - You can either choose the number of rounds or they can opt for infinite mode(by pressing 0).
  - You can choose the parameters for the game (ie: they choose the range involved which means they need to give us a low number and a high number where the mystery number will be between the two numbers we are given at the start of the game).
  - If you press the exit code ‚Äòxxx‚Äô or play the requested number of rounds, then the game end.
  - When the game ends, you are able to choose to see your game history.
  -There is a 3 different results in a single round, which is gold, silver or bronze depends on your number of guesses.
  -You will have an initial score for each round, which depend on the range you chose.(example: If you choose the range [1,100], your initial score gonna be 100. 
  -Each time you guess wrong, your score will be minus by 1
